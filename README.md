Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's widely used in various algorithms and data structures to provide elegant solutions for complex problems. This repository serves as a learning resource for understanding and practicing recursion through hands-on problems.


## What is Recursion?

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. It involves breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems until reaching a base case, which is a simple case that can be solved directly.

## Why Recursion?

Recursion provides an elegant and concise way to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. It often leads to simple and intuitive solutions for complex problems. Recursion is particularly useful for solving problems involving tree-like structures, such as traversing trees, searching graphs, or sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort.
